# Function 3 - Radar

Radar embedded on board Geibike is [ARS 408 from Continental Labs](https://conti-engineering.com/components/ars-408/). There's no
much more information about it.

## Installation of ARS 408 drivers and SDK

No drivers are provided by Continental, as this radar is intended to be used with their controller.

However, we found the technical documentation in [this repository](https://github.com/lf2653/myrepository), so we will try to
develop our own driver.
